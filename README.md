### 1. BMI Calculator:
#### Idea:
Takes User Input of either the Imperial or Metric System & showcases the output i.e. your BMI while stating your BMI according to international standard Categories.
#### ðŸ“Š BMI Categories used:

25.0 - 29.9 -	Overweight

30.0 and above -	Obese

#### How to Run:
Make sure Python is installed (python3 --version).

Save the code in a file, for example: bmi_calculator.py

Run it using the terminal:
python bmi_calculator.py

### 2. Time Assistant (Just a Stopwatch tho):
#### Idea:
A simple Python console stopwatch program that:

Displays a greeting based on the current time of day

Shows the current system time

Starts a stopwatch timer in the console

Stops the stopwatch when you press Ctrl + C
#### How to Run
Save the Python script (e.g., stopwatch.py) to your computer

Open your terminal or command prompt

Navigate to the folder containing the script

Run the script with:
python Time Assistant.py
The program will print a greeting and current time, then start the stopwatch

To stop the stopwatch, press Ctrl + C

### 3.Password Generator
#### Secure Password Generator
A simple yet cryptographically secure password generator built with Python.

#### Features:
Generates truly random passwords of customizable length

Option to include/exclude digits and special symbols

Uses Python's secrets module for cryptographically secure randomization

Clean command-line interface with input validation

Minimum password length enforcement (8 characters)

#### Requirements:
Python 3.6+
older versions if exists, need to modify the code & use the random module for generating passwords

#### Usage:
Run the script

Enter your desired password length

Choose whether to include digits and/or symbols

Receive your secure password

#### Security Notes:
Uses Python's secrets module (cryptographically secure random generator)

No forced character patterns - completely random selection

Minimum 8-character length enforced

Always prints security reminder about proper password storage

#### Customization:
Edit the script to:

Change default password length (line 4)

Modify minimum length requirement (line 22)

Adjust character sets (lines 7-12)



### 4.To-Do App (Ofcourse this is mandatory for a repo!)
